Configured for Delta style 3d printer. I am using Kossel
version but configuration is basically the same for any delta
style. I have added numerous updates to orginal version
		
- Z axis probe detection using accelerometer

Beta version with added delta move and homing calculations and several other features for delta printers.

To set rod height on a delta printer use command M251 which will allow you to measure 
the rod length or, if you have an LCD panel then you can select delta calibration in the
configuration menu.
